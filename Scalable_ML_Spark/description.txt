Columbia Berkeley CS190.1x. Scalable Machine Learning. Plaform Edx.

COURSE OVERVIEW
Machine learning aims to extract knowledge from data and enables a wide range of applications. 
With datasets rapidly growing in size and complexity, learning techniques are fast becoming a core 
component of large-scale data processing pipelines. This course introduces the underlying statistical 
and algorithmic principles required to develop scalable real-world machine learning pipelines. 
We present an integrated view of data processing by highlighting the various components of these pipelines, 
including feature extraction, supervised learning, model evaluation, and exploratory data analysis. 
Students will gain hands-on experience applying these principles by using Apache Spark to implement several scalable learning pipelines.

PREREQUISITES
Programming background; comfort with mathematical and algorithmic reasoning; familiarity with basic machine learning concepts; 
exposure to algorithms, probability, linear algebra and calculus; experience with Python (or the ability to learn it quickly). 
All exercises will use PySpark, but previous experience with Spark or distributed computing is NOT required. 
You should take this Python quiz before the course and take this Python mini-course if you need to learn Python or refresh your 
Python knowledge. This self-assessment document provides online resources that review additional 
relevant background material.
