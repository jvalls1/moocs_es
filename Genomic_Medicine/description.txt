Genomic_Medicie Gets Personal.

Course Description. 

While the advances in genomics promise to usher in a new era in medical practice and create a major paradigm shift in patient care, 
the ethical, legal, and social impact of genomic medicine will be equally significant. The information and potential use of genomic discoveries 
are no longer issues left for scientists and medical professionals to handle, but have become ones for the public at large. 
Rarely a day passes without a genomics-related story reported in the media. By the end of this course, students will be able to better 
understand the field of genomics; be familiar with various online databases and resources; and understand and appreciate the medical, 
social, ethical, and legal issues associated with the availability of personal genomic information.

Given the diversity of the topics and the specific expertise required to cover each, 
this is a unique cross-disciplinary course where faculty from different disciplines including genetics, computational sciences, 
bioinformatics, genetic counseling, bioethics, law, and business will participate in lecturing. 
We have assembled a team of experts from various departments at Georgetown University and other institutions, 
to teach this comprehensive online genomics course.
