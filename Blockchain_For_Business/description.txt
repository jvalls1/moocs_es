Discover the power of business blockchains and distributed ledger technologies with 
an overview of Hyperledger and introductions to its key frameworks. 
Blockchains have quickly gained popularity in several industries. 
This introductory course is carefully curated for both nontechnical and technical audiences. 
It examines blockchains for the enterprise and a number of pertinent use cases. 
Hyperledger is a group of open source blockchain-based projects organized by The Linux Foundation. 
Industries are researching how blockchains may increase efficiency and solve business problems associated 
with data privacy, security, information sharing, and inclusion. What are blockchain & distributed ledger 
technologies and how might they impact global business?

The course covers key features of blockchain technologies and the differentiators between various types of Hyperledger 
blockchain frameworks. We shall start with ‘What is blockchain?’ and open the discussion on where blockchain technology 
is suitable for your business requirements. We then take a deep dive into the enterprise-ready Hyperledger blockchain 
frameworks by guiding students through a demonstrated scenario.

Students with a technical background should be able to perform clean installations of Hyperledger Sawtooth and Hyperledger Fabric, 
as well as, develop simple applications on top of these frameworks. They will gain an understanding of various types of blockchains 
and which one is most suitable for any particular project.

Students with a business background should gain an understanding of how blockchains work and how they can create value for their
business through cost savings and efficiencies in terms of speed and simplicity. They will view how information is generated, stored, 
and shared in various blockchains, as well as, gain tools to evaluate whether or not a blockchain solution would be suitable for their 
particular business case.
